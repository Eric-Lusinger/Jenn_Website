    <h2>WELCOME!</h2>
<p> If you are here, you are on the brink of BIG change. CONGRATS!

    Are you feeling overwhelmed? Burned out? Exhausted, but can’t sleep? Do you envision the day where you can actually relax (and maybe even laugh at the absurdity of that idea). If so, you’re not alone in your need to do it all while having everything perfectly balances. You know you can’t keep going like this and think that it’s time for a change. Therapy is a wonderful place to start discussing these feelings and creating realistic goals in order to find more fulfillment in your day to day. My approach is Holistic Health– in session, we will cover areas such as physical, mental, emotional & spiritual. You are the expert of your life.
    
    Together, we can make your dream life a daily reality. You want to relax with your friends, family, and your pets. You want to be able to turn your brain off and enjoy a good book. You want to love yourself, like you love others. You are ready to feel the confidence and ease that everyone else sees.
    
    With the option for telehealth and/or in person services, starting therapy is easier than ever before. You can submit a consultation request through my website, or by calling/emailing. It’s simple to schedule your free no-obligation 20-minute phone or video consultation today.</p>

    <p>You are the expert of your life! Your feelings are valid.  My primary work is with individuals; however, therapy is most effective when loved ones are also involved. You are a product of your environment and often times that means bringing parents, significant others, and/or children into the therapy space to heal the people that are most important to you.
